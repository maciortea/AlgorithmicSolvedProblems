    // Write a function that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
    // For example, given:
    // X = 10
    // Y = 85
    // D = 30
    // the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
    // after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
    // after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
    // after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

    // Assume that:
    // - X, Y and D are integers within the range[1..1,000,000,000]
    // - X <= Y

    // - expected worst-case time complexity is O(1)
    // - expected worst-case space complexity is O(1)
